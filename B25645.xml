            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Eaſtern Tartary,</hi> after having enjoyed many Kings, worthy to govern that fine part of the World, in proceſs of time found it ſelf under the ſubjection of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan,</hi> a feeble Prince, and at the diſpoſal of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Queen, that ſuggeſted to him nothing but Violence. The City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> the uſual reſidence of it's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's, magnificent in all things, and illuſtrious by the Majeſty of ſix Kings that were then at the Court of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan,</hi> was upon the point of ſerving as a Theater to the cruelty of <hi>Zamur;</hi> that was the Name of the Queen.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:205892:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> had an only Daughter by his firſt Marriage, called <hi>Taxila,</hi> who was the Object of the Admiration of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom he deſtined to the Son of the Queen his Spouſe; this Prince, by name <hi>Timur,</hi> was King of <hi>Tenduc,</hi> and enjoyed as his utmoſt merit, the blind affection of an ambitious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was capable of ſacrificing all things to her Grandeur.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs of <hi>Tartary,</hi> was born with admirable Qualities: Nothing was ever ſeen comparable to her. The Charms of her mind bore an equality to thoſe of her Beauty: She poſſeſſed a a great Soul, a compleat Vertue and one may ſay, that Heaven had been in no wiſe wanting in its Favours to her. Her inclinations were very repugnant to the deſigns of the King her Father, and in ſpite of the pretentions of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> ſhe along time avoided what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute orders could prevail upon her. But her heart, which the Son of <hi>Zamar</hi> could not effect, was by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. <hi>Zingis</hi> preſcribed at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu,</hi> altho' he was guilty of no other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205892:5"/> Crime, than that of being too deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, cauſed ſome tender Diſquiets in the Princeſs. She ſaw all combined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan, Zamar, Timur,</hi> and many other Kings, cowardly Adorers of a Tyrannical Power. <hi>Taxila</hi> alone was of his party, with a perſeverance due to the Services of that illuſtrious Lover; but he was abſent, and the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Timur</hi> was Almighty through the Authority of his unjuſt Mother.</p>
            <p>One night, as <hi>Taxila</hi> was devoted to the remembrance of <hi>Zingis,</hi> ſhe heard a great Noiſe, and ſaw the King her Father enter into her Chamber, who came with his Eyes full of anger, to reproach her with a private correſpondence with his moſt mortal Enemy. After having vented an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of outragious Expreſſions, he commanded her to be ſtrictly guarded in her apartments, where he left her alone. The Princeſs judged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that this Enemy of whom he ſpoke, could be no other than <hi>Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis;</hi> but ſhe did not comprehend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what motives <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan,</hi> who from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205892:6"/> above a year paſt had left him ſome repoſe, renewed a perſecution, which time feemed to have abated, and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Memory a Perſon, that he had ſought to exclude from thence. An Officer of the Guards unfolded to her this Myſtery, in acquainting her, that <hi>Zingis</hi> was lately ſurprized at one of the Gates of the Palace upon the Banks of the River <hi>Polizangi,</hi> where <hi>Zamar</hi> had heard him ſpeak from a Terraſs, where ſhe was walking. That diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering by his diſcourſe, that he return'd to <hi>Cambalu</hi> for the Princeſs, ſhe order'd him to be aſſaulted; that Valour yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to force, they had over-whelmed him without being conquer'd; and brought him loaden with Irons to a diſmal Tower, where the vileſt Offenders were uſually encloſed.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe occaſioned a mortal grief in the Soul of <hi>Taxila.</hi> She made the <hi>Tartar</hi> depart, and ſuffering her ſelf to fall into the Arms of <hi>Axione,</hi> a Damſel; ſhe tenderly loved, becauſe ſhe was all charming. <hi>Ah! my dear</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:205892:6"/> Axione, ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>behold this fatal accident which I have ſo much fear'd and the generous</hi> Zingis <hi>is in the chains of the implacable</hi> Zamar. <hi>Alas! I ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patiently his abſence, becauſe it ſecured him from this barbarous Enemy; but he has precipitated himſelf into her hands, and 'tis ſtill the paſſion he entertains for me, that has conducted him thereto: All was ſweet and pleaſing, whilſt I conſidered that he loved me, and that I was under no occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſion of fear for him. I uſed to reckon up his Services, to pay them with my moſt tender affections, and I ſuffered the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of</hi> Timur, <hi>in hopes that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would never abandon me to a perſon, ſo little worthy of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The afflicted <hi>Taxila</hi> accompanyed theſe words with a Torrent of Tears; and the beautiful <hi>Axione,</hi> who by the liberty the Princeſs of <hi>Tartary</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, and the noble motions that encouraged her, did not ſtrive with her, but ſaid to her in receiving her Embraces, all that ſhe judged capable of moderating her diſpleaſure. <hi>No
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205892:7"/> Axione,</hi> replyed the ſorrowful Princeſs, <hi>There's nothing more to hope for.

                     <hi>Bahadur</hi> had by his Queen a double Off-ſpring; this illuſtrious <hi>Zingis</hi> whom Fortune expoſes to day after ſo cruel a manner; and the Princeſs <hi>Zenelia,</hi> who was ſurprized and carried away by the violence and force of a company of Robbers, in a Journy the Queen took, to receive the benefit of an Air that was more conformable to her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which was in a languiſhing State. The loſs of the innocent <hi>Zene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon her Vitals, that ſhe ſoon bad adieu to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205892:10"/> the World, leaving the youthful <hi>Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> for a conſolation to her Husband. He then went under the Name of <hi>Temuzin;</hi> but there was obſerved from his Infancy, ſuch enlivening marks of Grandeur and Courage, that the People gave him that of <hi>Zingis</hi> which is a proper Title for a peculiar, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bahadur</hi> with this Son ſo worthy of his affection, cancelled the thoughts of a more ample Poſterity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted his utmoſt cares to the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prince <hi>Zingis,</hi> whom a few years rendred perfectly accompliſhed. The King obſerved the encreaſe of his Perſon and noble Qualities, with a profound ſatisfaction. He could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the progreſs of his firſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he would not derogate from ſo many excellent perſons, from whoſe blood he deſcended, aſpiring to the real Character of Glory, giving Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the deſerved preference of all things, and ſhewing none but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inclinations. As ſoon as he had attained the ſeventeenth year of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205892:11"/> Age, he appeared with ſo much cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in his actions, and with ſo agreeable a behaviour, that nothing was ever ſeen comparable thereto. <hi>Bahadur</hi> encouraged his preſence; but the young Prince who had yet taſted nothing but the ſweetneſs of repoſe, and whoſe Courage demanded more tumultuous occupations, agitated in his thoughts how to abſent himſelf for ſome time from the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>

Hitherto I have given you no other marks than my Reſpects; but my Lord, that doth not ſuffice to ſatisfie the blood from whence our Vitals proceed. The profound Peace that the</hi> Monguls <hi>are under an obligation to your Courage for, doth not require that I ſhould remain at</hi> Molg <hi>in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual eaſe and obſcurity: We may have reaſon perhaps one day to bluſh for ſhame, and in all proba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205892:11"/> for a worthy Employment to Princes. If ſo be there is no occaſion for War in</hi> Aſia, <hi>it's neceſſary to enquire after it in</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>and return with a Reputation more Illuſtrious to the reſt of the World.</hi>

                  <p>This diſcoruſe flattered the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Courage of <hi>Bahadur;</hi> but at the ſame time he was exceeding fearful of his tender youth. <hi>Zingis,</hi> replyed he to the young Prince, <q rend="margQuotes">neither your noble Progenitors, nor the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Nations have any juſt Subject to reproach you with; and you have all along from your Infancy, addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelf to thoſe Employments which might procure you a glorious Futurity. I am ſenſibly ſatisfyed with your preſence, &amp; ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly afflicted at the news of your loſs: But yet, my Son, don't imagin that I am deſirous to confine you to a place, which in the opinion of the World, is more proper for the reſidence of furious Beaſts, than for Princes, on whom Heaven has be ſtowed ſome Merits. I don't op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this generous Emulation you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205892:12"/> ſeem to be inſpir'd with; but my dear <hi>Zingis,</hi> defer your intentions for a little time: You cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the King of <hi>Tartary</hi>'s threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to us all; perhaps he is ready to make a Declaration of War. The Tributes which he has exacted from ſeveral Kings, will moſt certainly extend to us, and then we ſhall have juſt cauſe for War. Ah! my Lord, interrupted <hi>Zingis,</hi> how uneaſily doth a perſon of my age and humour diſpenſe with ſuch Projects. I don't know whether the King of <hi>Tartary</hi> confounds us with other Princes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom he deſigns to erect a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority, but I'm of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that through the conſideration of your exploits, he'll conſult more than once upon the matter. In ſhort, my Lord, theſe are but uncertain Conjectures, and if ſo be you are not diſpoſed that I ſhould exceed the limits of <hi>Tartary,</hi> ſuffer me at leaſt to view the whole extent of it, that I may inform my ſelf of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Curioſities, which I have had but a confuſed Relation of.</q>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:205892:12"/>
                  <p>The King of the <hi>Monguls</hi> found ſo much reaſon in the Prince's Deſign, that he at length aſſented to his departure, but not without ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to himſelf, but under a proviſo, that he ſhould not paſs beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>Tartary.</hi> He gave him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to viſit the Court of <hi>

                  <p>The firſt things we made our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on, were the Tombs of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Princes: They are ſcituated amongſt Mountains which obſtruct not (at a great diſtance) the proſpect

                  <p>Coming near the place, we were informed that <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> to oblige his Queen, gave them the honour of his preſence.

                  <p>In a word, my Lord, this day which <hi>Timur</hi> deſigned to ſolemnize after an extraordinary manner, was remarked

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205892:20"/> perhaps forever to the bottom of the River. His action was ſo ſudden that no one elſe could prevent him.

The danger was great, ſince the Men that fell in the Water with <hi>Taxila,</hi> periſhed through the little care that was taken to relieve them, their negligence deſerving in ſome meaſure this unhappy Fate.

                  <p>The Princeſs opened her Eyes, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205892:21"/> regain'd her knowledge. When ſhe was laid upon the Bed, ſhe enquired after <hi>Axione,</hi> of whom they had taken the ſame care, and then fixed her ſelf to that repoſe which was convenient for her. The Night paſt away ſweetly, and finding her ſelf perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Morning, ſhe asked her Maids to which of the Tartars ſhe was indebted for her Life. Altho' ſhe had no good Opinion of <hi>Timur,</hi> yet ſhe was afraid leſt ſhe had received ſo important a ſervice from him, but being informed that it was <hi>Zingis,</hi> who had prevented the whole World with a precipitation full of zeal, ſhe had a ſecret ſatisfaction, and gave thanks to Heaven for it. They did not ceaſe to tell her, that the King of <hi>Tenduc</hi> did not ſo much as think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf for her, with which ſhe was pleaſed, as being diſengaged from any acknowledgment to him. As ſoon as it was day, <hi>Axione</hi> preſented her ſelf to the Princeſs, who moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced her. <hi>

In the mean time, <hi>Axione</hi> became ſo handſom, and I ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that I aimed at nothing but her ſight, and how to pleaſe her.

                  <p>I was not the only one that loved her in this manner, and you ſhall find I had a formidable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. <hi>Hildezar,</hi> Regent of <hi>Thibet,</hi> in an advanced Age, Father of <hi>Alzina</hi> and who had acquired much eſteem in our Countrey, and amongſt our Neighbours, by his good management of things, ſeeing the lovely <hi>Axione</hi> grown up, felt kindling in his heart for her, Fires of an extream vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

               <hi>Zamar,</hi> who ſaw her Vengeance no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, taſted thoſe Delights which barbarous Souls for the moſt part find in Cruelty. The feeble <hi>

It was not only the <hi>K.</hi> of <hi>Thibet, Almundzar,</hi> and ſome <hi>Tartars</hi> more emboldened than the reſt, that murmured at this horrible attempt. Amongſt the People and the Souldiers, there were found thoſe of a diſpoſition juſt enough, to be ſenſible of the deſert, and innocence of <hi>Zingis,</hi> and who demanded but a Captain, to declare openly in his favour.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:205892:53"/>
            <p>He was taken out of Priſon about the middle of the day, that the action might be the better obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His Guards made him aſcend the Chariot, that attended him, and the Executioner having ſecured his hands, familiarly ſat by him, to add diſgrace to Cruelty.</p>
            <p>The compoſed <hi>Zingis</hi> beheld all this without the leaſt amazement: His reſolution made the boldeſt of thoſe tremble that encompaſſed him; and many reflecting upon thoſe occaſions, where they had ſeen him acquire ſo much glory, caſt down their eyes and ſadly ſighed to ſee ſo great a Man deſtined to ſo deplorable a Fate. He never appeared with ſo much grace and Majeſty, as in this unhappy condition: His hands which had chained ſo many Kings, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Irons moſt couragiouſly; he diſpiſed his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious uſage, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven; <hi>Oh</hi> Taxila, ſaid he in a Tone loud enough, <hi>I give you my Life as heartily, as I would have done the Empire of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, if it had been at my diſpoſal. Accept thereof, as an aſſured teſtimony of my conſtant Love, and remember</hi> Zingis.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Chariot advanced, and there was ſeen throughout a deluge of Tears. The Men encouraged themſelves to preſerve <hi>Zingis.</hi> The Women asked his Life, and the very Children gave ſome Marks of tenderneſs. In coming near the great Square of the Palace, the Croud divided in a Spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place to let the Chariot paſs: 'Twas there the King of <hi>Thibet</hi> ſtopt. He would not ſuffer <hi>Almund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> to take Arms, that he might be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to Act in the conſequence. <hi>Zerbin</hi> alone, was near him, and at the firſt ſignal which they gave, the <hi>Monguls</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> oppoſed the paſſage of the Guards.</p>
            <p>This Obſtacle, which was ſo unexpected, cauſed a general ſurprize; the firſt thing which the King of <hi>Thibet</hi> did, was to ſtrike off the head of him that was to have been officious to <hi>Zingis</hi> in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

The feeble Spirits fled, and thoſe of a braver ſtrain, wanted aſſurance to advance. The Kings themſelves, whoſe ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made her ſo haughty and fierce, remained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, without daring to attempt. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid ſhe, in ſeeing them at the Palace Gate, and in the preſence of five other Kings, <hi>ſhall a raſh Criminal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, over the Laws, and our Authority, and bring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

Upon the time <hi>Zingis</hi> and <hi>Philing</hi> rendered themſelves Maſters of the Square, the preſence of <hi>

The King of <hi>Tartary</hi> retired pale, and trembling amongſt his own, and by this time the old Band of Souldiers, who quartered in the Suburbs, as we have ſaid, and who had leiſure to prepare themſelves, arrived on all ſides.

Whilſt <hi>Zingis, Philing, Zerbin,</hi> the unknown, and the <hi>Monguls</hi> with a Party of <hi>Tartars</hi> went on to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Conqueſt; <hi>Almundzar,</hi> who ſaw the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Princeſs without a Guard, was got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and found her terrifyed at the noiſe ſhe had heard, without knowing the Occaſion. <hi>Well, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundzar,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>is the King of the</hi> Monguls <hi>dead?

                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> was not neglectful of my Child-hood, and I am under an obligation to him, for having allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the Education of a King's Son: but with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the inſolence of <hi>Timur</hi> made me diſcern-that I was but a Slave becauſe he uſed me as his Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I ſuffered a long time, not hoping what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin. The arrivall of <hi>Zingis</hi> in <hi>Tartary</hi> detained me there, by the affection I ſelt for him; we carried our firſt Arms together; but at my return from the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:205892:57"/> War, being unable to live under a Power which the Authority of <hi>Zamar</hi> and the credit of <hi>Timur</hi> made unjuſt. I departed ſilently from <hi>Tartary,</hi> and went directly to viſit thoſe unhappy places, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Birth. Such melancholy Objects ſerved to afflict me. I deſcended towards the South, and came inſenſibly to the Kingdom of <hi>Thibet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas not long after the King's departure from <hi>Kachen</hi> when I arrived there: all things were in a ſolitary poſture: Thoſe that governed the State; taking the advantage of his abſence and of the ſmall experience which the Princeſs had in Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, aimed at their own profit, and uſurped too much Authority.</p>
                  <p>I firſt ſaw <hi>Thamirize</hi> in the Temple, where ſhe made her Devotions. Her modeſt and melancholy behaviour rendred her Beauty to my heart all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I well perceived I went to be in Love, and had not force enough to combat this diſpoſition. Having ſeen her but a moment, I burnt with a deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view her: but how could I be introduced to her preſence? The abſence of <hi>Philing</hi> made a ſolitary Court, and would admit no ſtrangers to the Palace. 'Twas neceſſary th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to expect from Fortune an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſatisfy my growing paſſion. The Idea of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>amirize</hi> did not abandon me; I returned to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but as it was a Publick place, ſhe went but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there.</p>
                  <p>I learnt, after I had made ſome reſidence at <hi>Kac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,</hi> that ſince the departure of the King, the Princeſs lived retired: That men had no ſort of Liberty near her perſon, not ſo much as thoſe of the firſt Quality; and that ſhe gave her own time for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, walking, or any other employment of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thoſe that I converſed with in a little time, made me a deſcription of her humour, which raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I learnt that ſhe was generous, compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, of an eaſy acceſs, when there was ſome reaſon to make application to her; ingenious in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:205892:58"/> and incapable of doing any Injuſtice. She had ſeveral Ladies of illuſtrious Families to attend upon her, and this ſmall Court, ſo little favourable to our Sex, inſpired me with the deſign of a young Man, fantaſtical, and bold at the ſame time, but the only one I thought capable of ſucceeding: Being of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable aſpect, I reſolved to take the habit of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In <hi>Thibet</hi> they are negligent enough, and I gave orders for ſome to be made, that were proper for a perſon of Quality, by the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is no body but this diſguiſe might have impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, even amongſt thoſe that were my Familiars, having nothing of affectation in my actions, and my face being likely to paſs for that of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Raviſhed to have found this opportunity, I aimed at nothing more than to put it in uſe; and two days more having perfectly accuſtomed me to the behaviour of a Woman, I directed my ſelf to the Gardens of the Palace, where my Habit eaſily introduced me. I walked there for ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: but at length <hi>Thamirize,</hi> who betook her ſelf to the Garden every day, came at her accuſtomed hour and paſſed near the place, where I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her reſpectfully: ſhe returned my civillity with an extraordinary goodneſs; and ſome few paces from thence, the Idea of my unknown Face ſtrike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her imagination, ſhe asked her Ladies, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her, if any of them had an acquaintance with me? All having anſwered no, and Fortune, willing that the Princeſs ſhould obſerve in me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of her curioſity, ſhe ſat down, and ordered one of her Ladies to go and pray me to come to her.

                  <p>Behold how my amorous Intrigue ſucceeded; I remained in the Palace amongſt the Ladies of the Princeſs, and I forgot no cautions that migh aſſure my ſecret, and leave me quiet poſſeſſor of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I enjoyed. In a few days I obtained no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare in the affection of the Princeſs. She gave me a thouſand innocent marks thereof, and ſeemed pleaſed to hear me talk: but that which I found moſt difficult was to conceal my Love, which I perceived each moment to encreaſe.

The Princeſs ſaw her ſelf at the ſame time without Enemies and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Protector; being moved at my misfortune, thinking my Death moſt certain, ſhe paſt through the Dead, and dying Bodies, and ſound me in a State worthy of her Tears, which ſhe poured out abundantly. <hi>Irmiza,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>my Dear</hi> Irmiza, <hi>why did you precipitate your ſelf into this danger?

He anſwered me immediately, and called her ſeveral times <hi>Axione.</hi> Weary of ſpeaking to him in vain, being then as well accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he, I fought him, and we had all put our ſelves in that Condition, that <hi>Axione</hi> alone remained ſtanding.</p>
            </q>
            <p> She was then ſeven years old. There came immediately ſeveral perſons on Horſeback, who in all probability took away <hi>Axione</hi> or <hi>Zenelia.</hi> As for me I loſt all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and was a long time in this unhappy ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e. But ſome Perſons who lived in the midſt of the Foreſt, where they kept ſome Flocks, came to the place where I was, and finding me not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deprived of Hear, they conveyed me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cave. It was more than ſix Months before my Legs could ſuſtain me, having no other aſſiſtance than ſome ſimples for my Cure. For want of ſtrength, I was obliged to live in this. Deſart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years. I by degrees accuſtomed my ſelf to it. But when time had ſent me a better health, the Remembrance of <hi>Zenelia</hi> revived my Zeal:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:205892:65"/> I left the Foreſt then at length, wherein my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had ſo long encloſed me. I have ſince ſearched and wandred in a thouſand places; but at laſt, hearing there was at <hi>Cambalu</hi> an unknown Damſel, named <hi>Axione,</hi> I directed my courſe hither; I have ſeen her, and I find that 'tis <hi>Zenelia,</hi> ſo near reſembling the Queen her Mother, that the leaſt diſtinction is not to be diſcerned. Then <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphanes</hi> produced a Picture of the Queen of the <hi>Monguls</hi> which he had preſerved; and if it had been made for <hi>Axione,</hi> there could not have been a more exact Reſemblance. All the Circumſtances of her fortune ſo juſtly relating to that of <hi>Zenelia,</hi> no body queſtioned but that ſhe was the Princeſs of the <hi>Monguls Zingis</hi> a thouſand times embraced this lovely Siſter, who tenderly returned him her Careſſes. <hi>Taxila</hi> and <hi>Thamirize</hi> teſtifyed their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Joy for <hi>Zenelia,</hi> by all that could expreſs it; and <hi>Philing</hi> tranſported, caſt himſelf at her feet. <hi>Zingis</hi> aſſured him that ſhe was his own, and the young Princeſs did not contradict this Illuſtrious Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> learnt this diſcovery, whereof Old <hi>Metaphanes</hi> told him the Particulars. In a word. Joy was diſperſed through the whole Palace, and the wiſhed for time, when theſe ſix Perſons were to be united, was fully come.</p>
            <p>This great day was ſolemnized after a glorious manner. Never did ſo much Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour appear at a time. The Temple where the Ceremony of Marriage was to be performed, was filled by an infinite Number of <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and Strangers. The King of <hi>Thibet</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Brema</hi> bore up the Imperial Robe of <hi>Zingis,</hi> and <hi>Zenelia</hi> and <hi>Thamirize,</hi> that of <hi>Taxila.</hi> The Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Crowns were laid upon a ſtately Throne, and after theſe happy Lovers were for ever joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> Crowned <hi>Zingis</hi> and <hi>Taxila,</hi> with his own hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which the New Emperor
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:205892:66"/> Crowned <hi>Philing</hi> and <hi>Omir,</hi> and the Empreſs <hi>Taxila</hi> did the ſame Honour to <hi>Zenelia</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirize.</hi> All places Ecchoed with Exclamations of joy. The People repeated the Names of <hi>Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> and <hi>Taxila</hi> without intermiſſion, and all ſorts of Pleaſures in the Palace, concluded this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable day. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> would be no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Cares, nor preſerve the leaſt Mark of his dignity, reſigning all to Perſons that ſo well deſerved ſuch Honours. A little after it was known, as <hi>Philing</hi> had foreſeen, that <hi>Benzid</hi> and <hi>Othriz</hi> had periſhed in their Factions, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from <hi>Thibet</hi> came to aſſure their King, that his People had ſubmitted to him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Tartary,</hi> by the Importunities of <hi>Zingis,</hi> as well as <hi>Omir</hi> with the Title of King of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Zingis</hi> much encreaſed the Limits of <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> and teſtifyed by his Liberality to the Princeſs his Siſter, how dear and valuable ſhe was to him. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndkan</hi> lived but a little while, and was lamented becauſe the laſt of his Actions had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the remembrance of the reſt. In a word, <hi>Zingis</hi> founded the moſt powerful Empire of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and rendered his Name ſo Illuſtrious, that the whole World was filled with it. He Subdued the <hi>Indies, Perſia,</hi> and all that part which extends from the River <hi>Tigris</hi> to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olga. Philing</hi> and <hi>Omir</hi> were ſharers in the glory, and followed him in his proſperous Expeditions. <hi>Almundzar</hi> was conſidered by him, as he well deſerved; <hi>Metaphanes</hi> dyed with the ſatisfaction of ſeeing <hi>Zenelia</hi> Queen of <hi>Thibet: Zerbin</hi> received rewards due to his fidelity; and theſe Princes, loaded with Honours and with happy Years, left behind them a large and glorious Poſterity.</p>
